# ParaDraw

Drawing tools for visual debugging in [VRChat](https://vrchat.com) worlds.

Like [Unity Gizmos](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Gizmos.html) or [Debug.DrawLine](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Debug.DrawLine.html) but available at runtime so you can test in VR or on Android.
